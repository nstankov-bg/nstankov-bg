## 👋 About Me

Hi there! I'm Nikolay, a Senior DevOps Engineer with a strong background in Serverless(<3 Vercel, make me unemployed quickly!), AWS, and VSphere. I have a passion for developing efficient and scalable cloud(& hybrid) infrastructures, and I'm always eager to explore and learn new technologies. My coding experience spans across multiple languages and frameworks, including PHP, TypeScript, Go, Python.

In addition to my DevOps expertise, I have a keen interest in AI & ML, particularly in deep learning, LLM, LangChain, and creating custom models for document ingestion. As a blockchain enthusiast, I have experience with cryptocurrency and was part of [Alonzo Blue](https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-grows-closer-to-launching-smart-contracts-with-new-testnet), the first cohort of Plutus pioneers in the Cardano blockchain.

## 🛡️ Security & Code Quality

With years of experience in infrastructure as code, I have gained expertise in both Day 0 and Day 1 operations. I take security very seriously and want to believe I am proficient in secrets management, code scanning, and code quality. I have implemented numerous quality & security-focused automations, ranging from SonarQube through Snyk and into modern decentralized suites like Pyrsia.

In addition to implementing security best practices, I believe that maintaining high code quality is essential for building scalable and reliable systems. I'm experienced in using static code analysis tools, linters, and automated testing frameworks to ensure code is clean, efficient, and adheres to industry standards.

## 📚 Continuous Learning

I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with industry trends. Some topics I'm currently exploring include:

- Advanced Kubernetes concepts and tools, such as service meshes and policy management
- Distributed systems and microservices architectures
- Ethics and best practices in AI/ML development
- Applying DevOps principles to data engineering and data science workflows

## 🌟 Open-Source Contributions

As a dedicated advocate of open-source software, I actively participate in a variety of projects that resonate with my areas of expertise. My primary interests lie in projects focusing on cloud infrastructure, DevOps, AI & ML, and blockchain technologies. Through my contributions to open-source initiatives, I strive to share my knowledge, foster innovation, and help shape the future of the tech industry. In doing so, I am able to collaborate with like-minded professionals, enhance my skillset, and remain at the forefront of cutting-edge developments in the field.
